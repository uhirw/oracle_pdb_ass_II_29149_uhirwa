**Oracle Pluggable Database Assignment II**

**Overview of Tasks**


This assignment required working with Oracle Database Pluggable Databases (PDB).
The tasks included creating a new PDB, creating and deleting another PDB, accessing Oracle Enterprise Manager, and documenting the work.





**Oracle Environment Used** 


 Oracle Database 21c Express Edition
 Docker container     
 Ubuntu Linux operating system
 SQL for database commands
 Oracle Enterprise Manager Express (OEM) for monitoring


    
    
    
**Explanation of Each Task**


**Task 1 – Create a New PDB**


In this task, I created a new pluggable database using the required naming format.
After creating the PDB, I opened it and confirmed that it was working.
Then, I created a new user inside the PDB which will be used for other future classes






**Task 2 – Create and Delete a PDB**


In this task, I created a temporary PDB using the required naming format.
I verified that the PDB was created successfully.
After verification, I deleted the temporary PDB completely using SQL commands.
Then I confirmed that the PDB no longer existed.






**Task 3 – Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)**



In this task, I tried accessing Oracle Enterprise Manager Express using the web browser(which did not work at all).
I couldn't log in using administrator credentials due  to some issues that i met which i explalined in the challenges faced and solutions
 section 
 
 


    

    
**Challenges Faced and Solutions**


**OEM Not Opening**

Oracle Enterprise Manager can not open in the browser.





**Solution:**


i still have not find the solution to this problem because port is enabled but OEM can't open and according to my research, new version of Linux doesn't support Oracle 21c which made me use docker inside of it to later meet those issues of not being able to browse OEM.




**Integrity Statement**


I confirm that this assignment was completed by me.
All commands were executed in my own Oracle environment, and the work submitted is original.
